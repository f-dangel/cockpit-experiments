# Instructions to reproduce this experiment

1. Run experiment: `bash run.sh` (creates a `results` directory with data).
   Alternatively, extract the `results.zip` to use our original results: `unzip
   results.zip`.

2. Plot results: `python plot.sh` (creates a `output` directory with plot)

3. Clean up or start over: `bash clean.sh` (removes `results` directory)
